The Northeastern and Southern Mensurationists are informal groups of forest biometricians, mensurationists, statisticians, mathematicians, modelers, and other computational foresters interested in various aspects of quantitative forestry.  Past conferences of these two groups have provided a diverse range of presentations given by professionals and students. The level of presentation is often diverse, but we welcome talks designed to be accessible to all, without sacrificing content. Graduate students are especially encouraged to think of this venue as a friendly place to get feedback on their proposed research work or work in progress.

Suggested topics for discussion include:

Quantitative Management
Plantation Management
Computational Forestry
Inventory Issues
Growth and Yield Modeling
Data and databases
Other topics such as harvest scheduling and remote sensing and GIS applications are also welcome.

We hope to see you in November!
